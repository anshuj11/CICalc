application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version  - ruby 2.4.4p296

* System dependencies

* Configuration:  

* Database creation  rails db:create CICalc

* Database initialization  rails db:migrate

* How to run the test suite : Not able to finish writing tests

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.) 

* Deployment instructions

rails s
In the browser type URL:  http://localhost:3000/queries
  


To do:
* Real time update of query result on the page ( instead of serving it from back-end)  
* Writing tests
* Initially assumed it was Compound Interest . Fixed later but there maybe references to Compound Interest instead of Simple Interest in the code. Find and fix.
